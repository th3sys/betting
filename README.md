# Horse Power

A horse betting strategy:
  - Back a horse in-play when the odds drop below x

Backtests ran on the data obtained from **Betfair** for the period from 1st Oct 2018 till 30th Oct 2018.

For x = 1.5 if we traded on every horse racing event in GB and IR during the month of October 2018 we would have had 801 winning trades and 316 losers.
For x = 1.4 - 865 winners and 251 losers.
For x = 1.3 - 946 winners and 170 losers.
